# DMS Project

This repository contains a set of Spring Boot microservices for the DMS application.

## Services and default ports

| Service | Module | Default port |
|---|---|---|
| Eureka Server | `eureka-server` | `8761` |
| User Service | `user-service` | `8082` |
| Order Service | `order-service` | `8083` |
| Product Service | `product-service` | `8084` |
| Inventory Service | `inventory-service` | `8085` |
| Audit Service | `audit-service` | `8086` |
| Distributor Service | `distributor-service` | `8087` |

> Note: This README uses a consistent local port mapping for the services. If your current `application.properties` files use different ports, update the values there to match your local setup.

## Required dependencies

- Java 17
- Maven (or use the included Maven wrapper `mvnw.cmd` on Windows)
- MySQL running locally on `localhost:3306`
- Database: `dms_db`

## Database setup

Create the `dms_db` database if it does not exist:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dms_db;
```

The services are configured with the default MySQL credentials:

- username: `root`
- password: `Your_Password`

If your credentials are different, update the database settings in each service's `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

## Start the application as a whole

### Option 1: Start all services at once with Java 17 LTS (Recommended)
You can start all backend services (Eureka, User, Product, Order, Inventory, Audit, and Distributor) simultaneously in separate terminal windows with Java 17 configured automatically:
Run the batch wrapper from cmd/powershell:

  ```powershell
  .\start-all.bat
  ```

This script ensures that the Eureka Server starts first, waits 12 seconds for it to bind, and then starts all other services with Java 17 LTS.

### Option 2: Start services manually one-by-one
If you prefer starting services manually (ensure your terminal/session is using Java 17 LTS):

1. Start the Eureka server first:

```powershell
cd eureka-server
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

2. Start the other services in separate terminals:

```powershell
cd audit-service
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

cd ..\inventory-service
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

cd ..\product-service
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

cd ..\order-service
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

cd ..\user-service
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

cd ..\distributor-service
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

## Start services individually

Each service can be run separately from its own folder:

```powershell
cd <module-name>
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

For example:

```powershell
cd user-service
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

## Access URLs

- Eureka dashboard: `http://localhost:8761`
- User service UI: `http://localhost:8082/users/login`

## Notes

- Services use Eureka for discovery, but they also include direct URLs in configuration to simplify local testing.
- The user-service UI is the main entry point for admin and distributor workflows.
- Audit logs are stored by `audit-service` and can be viewed from the admin UI if that endpoint is enabled.

## Troubleshooting

- If a port is already in use, update the `server.port` value in the relevant service `application.properties` file.
- If the database schema is missing, verify `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` is enabled in the service configuration.
- If services fail to register with Eureka, make sure Eureka is running on `http://localhost:8761/eureka/`.
